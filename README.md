To speed the loading of websites, each ISP caches a copy of DNS records for a period of time, sometimes up to 48 hours. This means that they make their own copy of the registrars' master DNS records, and reads from them locally instead of making a direct request to the domain registrar every time a request for your site is made. This speeds up web surfing quite a bit by:
decreasing the return time it takes for a web browser to request a domain lookup and get an answer and
reducing the amount of traffic on the web.
